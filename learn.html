        <p>My number one priority as a tutor is my students' success. I believe that academic success comes from repetition, and having a good student-teacher relationship. As such, while my rate is $50/hour for tutoring, I offer discounted rates for regularly scheduled tutoring. I also encourage you to reach out even if your needed subjects are not all listed. I would be happy to familiarize myself with different subjects in order to meet the needs of any of my regular students. This can include, but is not limited to, brushing up on modern SAT/ACT rubrics and studying specific content for history classes. Once we determine that I am the right tutor for you or your child</p>
